Remember, each group is separated into enough cards for MTG Arena to import them successfully.
Pay attention to the large group of line breaks between each segment.
Each deck should have 200 cards. The Last Deck will have a line after it letting you know how many cards are in the deck (in case of errors.)

4 Goblin Ruinblaster (HA2) 12
4 Merrow Reejerey (HA2) 5
4 Nyx-Fleece Ram (HA2) 1
4 Virulent Plague (HA2) 9
